# Disney Princess Pixel Matrix
I made this project as a gift for my sister. I used the pixel art created by mudkat101 on deviant art and created them into actual 16x16 pixel images.
I then used the included python script to convert the pixels into RGB values in the correct order to be displayed on a WS2812B 16x16 matrix.
I have also included the stl files I used to build the final product.

The code is fairly straight forward. I store off all the pixel values into progmem due to the limited space on an Arduino Nano. It shuffles around 
the princesses in random order and transitions after three minutes changing each pixel randomly.
